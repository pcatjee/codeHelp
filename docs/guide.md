# Guide

Selective **Bold** Example.

## Heading

Inserting a **Link** Example.

So here is the example linking **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### Bullet Points and sub points

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Code with Copy button

Here is an Example of **Code and copy** button.

```bash
npx react-native@latest init AwesomeProject
```

## A normal text example

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Another Code Example of multiple line

Color for some commands changes automatically, like in below case color of npm changes when viewed in browser.

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

## Highlighting

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
